# CA4-Assignment

Overall approach:

I wanted to create a dark minimalistic design for my web pages and keep a general 
pixel-art theme. I feel like I achieved this through my font selection and GIF 
animated backgrounds adding an a retro aspect to my pages. 

Challenges:

My biggest challenge was implementing js into the chat page. I altered the overall 
layout of the message board and added some more detailed descriptions about the messages
sent and received. I also implemented a notification popup whenever a user joins or
leaves the chat room. Sadly I was unable to add a "typing..." feature but I am going to
spend some time soon to get that working in my own time.
